#This is a proposed github project for OWASP

The goal of this project is to creat a working vulnerable set of systems that utilize one or more blockchain testnets (or fakes them well), this system will look at the pitfalls of current blockchain projects and model them to create multiple vulnerable applications that can be exploited to violate anything related to smart contracts, cross chain bridges, NFTs, and other blockchain technologies and help educate developers much in the manner of Darn Vulnerable Applications or the OWASP Goat Series.  An Oracle might be a great place to get going.

Do not use this project in the real world, it is intentionally made vulnerable.
